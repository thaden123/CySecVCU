            <p>The Vice President should assist the Club/President with all logistical matters. The Vice President may also be useful for
                the purposes of representation at meetings/engagements the President cannot attend. The Vice President should be
                contributing to the group weekly by either contributing to the Hands On Training or providing some other meeting based
                service. In tune with the vision of the group, the Vice President should be a solid idea contributor and someone who's voice
                should hold a significant amount of influence over the organizations operations. </p>

            <p>The Treasurer should be a trustworthy, dependable, motivated, and capable member. The treasurer bares the duty to deal
                with club funding. This includes staying on top of SGA deadlines and making sure paperwork is filled out. This member
                should work with the dedicated Funding overseer (defined above as either the President or Vice President) to make sure
                the clubs goals can be met via university funding. As a result of his/her hard work, the input of this member is to be
                sought out before any substantial changes, events, ideas, challenges, ect. to the organization are performed. The Treasurer
                has a lot of weight on their shoulders, give them the respect the deserve for it. </p>
